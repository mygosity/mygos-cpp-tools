# Welcome to my C++ playground

### Please install Boost for your operating system and then run the install command below. This will autogenerate scripts to make it easier.

```bash
    sh install.sh {platform}
    # where platform can be w for windows, m for mac, l for linux
        example:
            sh install.sh m
    # afterwards run
    sh create.sh
    
    #if on linux/mac
    sh make.sh
    sh run.sh
    
    #on windows just open the visual studio project that is in the new project folder
```
